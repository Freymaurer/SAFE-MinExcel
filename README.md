# SAFE-MinExcel [WIP]

This is meant as a minimal template to set up an Office Excel web add-in. It currently works for excel online. Sideloading the app for the desktop version needs some testing.

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 5.0 or higher
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

1. Download repo.
2. Run install.cmd as admin.
3. To start the app run `dotnet run` in the root directory.
4. Webside can be accessed under 'https://localhost:3000'

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.

Finally, there are `Bundle` and `Azure` targets that you can use to package your app and deploy to Azure, respectively:

```bash
dotnet run -- Bundle
dotnet run -- Azure
```
